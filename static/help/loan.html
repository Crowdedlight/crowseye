<h1>STAHP Loan Program Guide</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The STAHP Loan Program is designed to empower newbros into ISK making through daytripping. Ships are provided for daytrips, and the resulting ISK profit is split 60/40 between the newbie and the loan program, in the newbie's favor. Ideally, the newbie will be able to purchase his own ship within 2-3 trips.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>1. Any newbie can apply to receive a loaner ship at the beginning of a fleet by contacting the FC.</p>
<p>2. The newbie is not charged anything up front, and is not charged anything for the loss of the loaner boat or anything at all until loot is acquired</p>
<p>3. The newbie will be flagged on the loot sheet so that 25% of his cut will be given to the loan program and STAHP SRP</p>
<p>4. A newbie may be banned from receiving a loaner boat in the future if he loses it by not following FC orders and/or otherwise being entirely too dumb too live.</p>
<p>5, The newbie must fulfil the basic skill requirements for sitting in the boat to receive a loan.</p>
<p>6. The boat must be returned at the end of the fleet.</p>
