Our objective is for Baers to teach newbies how to scan and make ISK in wormholes, and run fleets to make sweet sweet ISK for your whelping wallet. We will be running teaching fleets for sites, and clearing out wormholes for delicious blue loot as and when we have good holes from Catch. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c5"><span>Our doctrine ships include the Vexor Navy Issue, the Myrmidon, the Dominix, supported by Guardians, Basiliks or Scythes depending on what we need. You don&rsquo;t even need to go out of your way from BRAVE Doctrines to fly our fleets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c5"><span>Not a Logi 5 pilot? No problem, we have T1 versions ready to go, as well as Remote Repping DPS fits. Can&rsquo;t afford any of our DPS ships? We can lend you one until you can afford your own. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c5"><span>If you add a signature to our tracker and we run the sites, you will get &lt;</span><span class="c2">Placeholder: a finders fee. Insert number or % here</span><span>&gt; So, any time you come across a wormhole in your exploring, jump in and add it to our tracker! It could make you isk. It also gives you a reason to scan down wormholes as deep as you can! You never know what you&rsquo;ll find we can run.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">Scanning and adding signatures, the what why and how. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Placeholder section until the Signature Adder is up and running and I&rsquo;ve had a play to figure it out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">The Fleet for Sites.</span></p><p class="c5"><span>Okay, so, now you&rsquo;ve been adding signatures, and one of them has caught the eye of a STAHP FC. At this point we will start forming a fleet. All you need to do is find the fleet that&#39;s being advertised to run the sites, and join it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c5"><span>Once you&rsquo;re in the fleet, the MOTD will contain the information of what we&rsquo;re running and what ships you need to bring. We have Shield tank for C3/C2 sites, and Armor for C5. A full list of our doctrines is available in the STAHP Public channel, &lt;</span><span class="c2">Placeholder here for the name of the public channel</span><span>&gt;, so check them out. If you can fly the doctrines but don&rsquo;t have a ship, that&#39;s absolutely fine, just speak to the FC and you can borrow one of ours. You will lose part of your cut to pay for the loaner fee, but you&rsquo;ll still be making enough ISK to pay for your own, and get yourself a ship for a full cut.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c5"><span>The easiest ship of the doctrine to get into is the Vexor Navy Issue, and since these are recommended to rat in catch with, there&rsquo;s no reason NOT to train into them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c5"><span>If you can&rsquo;t run a T2 tank, speak to the FC and check if its okay to meta-down the fit. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c5"><span>We will have limited places on the fleet if you can&rsquo;t fit any of the doctrine ships, your job will be to sit on the wormholes in and tell us if anything comes through or if anything new spawns. Yes, you get paid there to sit and watch a movie, read a book, whatever you want to do. Just pay attention to your client and have wormhole sounds turned RIGHT up so you can hear it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c5"><span>After the FC has got the numbers they need and we&rsquo;re ready to go, just follow the commands and put those hardeners on, follow the FC&rsquo;s commands and harvest those sleeper tears.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c5"><span>Broadcast fast for reps, pay attention, don&rsquo;t shoot anything you&rsquo;re not told to, and everything should run nice and smooth. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c5"><span>Once the sites are cleared, the FC will turn you round and head home. Scouts, this is once again where you earn your ISK! If you have a loaner ship, contract or trade it back to the FC. Payouts will not be given out for those using loaner ships until yours has been returned. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c5"><span>At this point, all you need to do is carry on with your game and wait for that wallet to blink as the FC pays out. This could take a day or two, but be patient. We know who you are and what you need paying, Just make sure you&rsquo;re in the correct squad in the fleet when its running! The FC will take a list of names and roles just before we begin, and let us know if you have to go early.</span></p>
